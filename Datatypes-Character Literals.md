# Ex-1C VARIABLES & EXPRESSIONS OPERATOR

## Aim
To write a python program to perform floor division on the given integer values.
## Algorithm
1.	Read and evaluate input for variables "a" and "b".
2.	Perform  floor division of "a" by "b" using the operator and initiate to variable ‚Äúc‚Äù.
3.	Print the result of the  floor division.
4.	End of the program.
## üßæ Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a//b
print(c)
```
